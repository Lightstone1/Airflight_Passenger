 Analyzing "Airline Passenger Satisfaction" with Power BI

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to gain valuable insights into airline passenger satisfaction levels using Power BI, a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool. By analyzing various aspects of passenger experiences, customer profiles, and the impact of flight distance on preferences, we aim to identify the key factors contributing to customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction within the airline industry.

## Introduction:
Airline passenger satisfaction is a critical metric for the aviation industry. Happy passengers are more likely to become loyal customers, while dissatisfied passengers may seek alternative airlines for their future travel needs. Understanding the factors that influence passenger satisfaction is essential for airlines to enhance their services and remain competitive in a dynamic market.
